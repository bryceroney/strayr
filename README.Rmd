There are many great sources of Australian data for use by analysts.
This package aims to simplify access to those datasets by providing them
in a consistent and easy to use format. It also contains a number of
helper functions to assist with analysis work.

This package is currently **in development** and subject to change. The
lifecycle badge will be changed to `stable` when it is stable (should be
relatively soon).

**Contribute to this package**: This package is part of
[runapp](https://github.com/runapp-aus): the Australian R Users Network
of Australian Public Policy, people are actively encouraged to
contribute to this package.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `strayr` with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("runapp-aus/strayr")
```

## What's in the box?

The `strayr` package provides tools to make working with Australian data
easier. This includes:

-   tidy versions of common structures used by the Australian Bureau of
    Statistics (ABS);
-   tidy versions of other helpful datasets like Australian public
    holidays; and
-   helper functions to help you work with your data.

### Structures

Current structures stored in `strayr` are:

| Dataset name | Title |
|---|---|
| `?anzsco` | Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations |
| `?anzsic` | Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification |
| `?asced_foe` | Australian Standard Classification of Education - Field of education levels |
| `?asced_qual` | Australian Standard Classification of Education - Qualification levels |


### Other datasets
- `?auholidays` contains a tidy dataset of Australian public holidays and an associated helper function `is_holiday()`
- The package also loads [`absmapsdata`](https://github.com/wfmackey/absmapsdata), which contains ASGS (like `absmapsdata::sa12016`) and non-ASGS structures (like `absmapsdata::ced2018`) *and their geometry* as `sf` objects.

### Helper functions
* Functions to help clean data, including `clean_state()` and `clean_anzsco()`. An example of how to clean state names can be found in `vignette("clean_state")`
* The `get_seifa()` function to download [SEIFA](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2033.0.55.001Main+Features12016?OpenDocument) data.
